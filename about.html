            <p>This website is a hands-on project built with the core languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are no large frameworks or complex back-ends. The goal was to create a fast, clean, and reliable application using fundamental technologies.</p><br>
            <p>You might be wondering how your notes and tasks persist without an account. The magic lies in your browser's localStorage API. When you type, JavaScript instantly saves your data directly to your own computer's browser. This means everything is stored locally on your device, not on a server we control. It's private, fast, and works completely offline after your first visit.</p><br>
            <p>We believe in simplicity and efficiency. This project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of modern JavaScript and your web browser, providing a seamless and clutter-free experience for managing your daily thoughts and tasks.</p><br>
